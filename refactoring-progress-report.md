â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __tests__/
â”œâ”€â”€ quiz/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __tests__/
â”œâ”€â”€ chat/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __tests__/
â””â”€â”€ shared/
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/

### Overall Coverage: 90.25%
- **Statements**: 90.25%
- **Branches**: 86.4%
- **Functions**: 79.57%
- **Lines**: 90.25%

### Areas Needing Coverage Improvement

1. **socketClient.ts** (63.81% coverage)
   - Uncovered lines: 144-345, 356-361
   - Needs tests for error handling and edge cases

2. **RoomList.tsx** (91.37% coverage)
   - Uncovered lines: 165, 242-251, 303
   - Missing tests for error states and socket events

3. **userStorage.ts** (89.14% coverage)
   - Uncovered lines: 212-220, 381-382
   - Needs tests for cookie storage edge cases

4. **Room Page** (89.94% coverage)
   - Uncovered lines: 64-80, 182-184
   - Missing tests for sessionStorage handling and cleanup

5. **Quiz Game Page** (95.08% coverage)
   - Uncovered lines: 65-68, 86-87
   - Needs tests for edge cases

6. **Modal.tsx** (92.5% coverage)
   - Uncovered lines: 41-44, 60-61
   - Missing tests for keyboard events

## Next Steps for 100% Coverage

### High Priority (Biggest Coverage Gains)
1. **Complete socketClient.ts tests**
   - Add tests for socket initialization
   - Test error handling scenarios
   - Test reconnection logic
   - Mock socket.io events properly

2. **Implement useRoomList hook**
   - Complete implementation based on written tests
   - Extract logic from RoomList component
   - Achieve 100% coverage for the hook

3. **Refactor RoomList component**
   - Use new useRoomList and useSocketConnection hooks
   - Split into smaller components
   - Add missing test cases

### Medium Priority
4. **Complete userStorage.ts coverage**
   - Add tests for cookie parsing errors
   - Test storage fallback scenarios
   - Cover error recovery paths

5. **Fix Modal.tsx coverage**
   - Add tests for onClose with keyboard events
   - Test overlay click handling

6. **Complete Room page coverage**
   - Test sessionStorage scenarios
   - Test component cleanup

### Low Priority
7. **Minor coverage gaps**
   - QuizGame edge cases
   - QuizCreator error states

## Refactoring Recommendations

### Component Splitting Strategy
1. **RoomList.tsx** â†’ Split into:
   - RoomListContainer (state management)
   - RoomListView (presentation)
   - RoomCard (individual room display)
   - RoomFilters (filter controls)
   - CreateRoomDialog (room creation)

2. **Room.tsx** â†’ Split into:
   - RoomContainer (state management)
   - ChatSection (chat functionality)
   - UserList (user display)
   - QuizManagement (quiz controls)
   - RoomHeader (room info display)

3. **QuizGame.tsx** â†’ Split into:
   - QuizGameContainer (state management)
   - QuizQuestion (question display)
   - QuizTimer (timer component)
   - QuizResults (results display)
   - PlayerScores (score tracking)

4. **QuizCreator.tsx** â†’ Split into:
   - QuizCreatorContainer (state management)
   - QuizForm (form controls)
   - ImageUploader (image handling)
   - QuizPreview (preview display)

## Architecture Benefits Achieved
1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Custom hooks extract business logic
2. **Improved Testability**: Smaller, focused units easier to test
3. **Reusability**: Hooks can be shared across components
4. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript types throughout
5. **TDD Approach**: Tests written before implementation

## Estimated Time to 100% Coverage
- socketClient.ts tests: 2-3 hours
- useRoomList implementation: 1-2 hours
- RoomList refactoring: 3-4 hours
- Remaining coverage gaps: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 8-12 hours

## Conclusion
The refactoring process has successfully improved the codebase structure and test coverage. The implementation of custom hooks following TDD principles provides a solid foundation for further improvements. Reaching 100% coverage is achievable with focused effort on the identified gaps, particularly socketClient.ts and the component refactoring tasks.
