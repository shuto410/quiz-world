## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### TDD Approach (t-wada Style)

1. **Red Phase**: Wrote comprehensive failing tests first
   - Defined expected behaviors and user interactions
   - Covered edge cases and error scenarios
   - Established clear acceptance criteria

2. **Green Phase**: Implemented minimal code to pass tests
   - Created page components with required functionality
   - Integrated existing QuizCreator and QuizGame components
   - Added proper navigation and state management

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improved code quality and maintainability
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback
   - Optimized component integration
   - Fixed test assertion issues

### Architecture Decisions

#### Page-Level Integration
- **Dedicated Routes**: Each quiz component has its own page route
- **Component Reuse**: Leveraged existing QuizCreator and QuizGame components
- **State Management**: URL parameters for quiz game state persistence
- **Navigation Flow**: Clear user journey between pages

#### Data Flow
```
Home Page → QuizCreator Page → Quiz Creation → Back to Home
Home Page → QuizGame Page → Game Play → Back to Home
```

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback UI for missing data
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and loading states
- **Navigation Safety**: Always provide way back to home
