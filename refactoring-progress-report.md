# Quiz World Application Refactoring Progress Report

## Executive Summary
- **Current Test Coverage**: 91.33% (up from 88.59%)
- **Tests Status**: 264 passed, 1 skipped
- **Refactoring Approach**: Google Senior Engineer perspective with TDD focus

## Completed Work

### 1. Project Structure Analysis
- Identified 4 large components needing refactoring:
  - RoomList.tsx (400+ lines)
  - QuizGame.tsx (407 lines)
  - Room.tsx (371 lines)
  - QuizCreator.tsx (380 lines)

### 2. Feature-based Architecture Implementation
Created new folder structure documentation in `src/features/README.md`:
```
src/features/
├── room/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── services/
│   └── __tests__/
├── quiz/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── services/
│   └── __tests__/
├── chat/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── __tests__/
└── shared/
    ├── components/
    ├── hooks/
    └── utils/
```

### 3. Custom Hooks Development (TDD Approach)
✅ **useSocketConnection Hook**
- Test file: `src/features/room/hooks/useSocketConnection.test.ts`
- Implementation: `src/features/room/hooks/useSocketConnection.ts`
- Status: Fully implemented with 87.17% coverage
- Features:
  - Connection state management
  - Auto-reconnection handling
  - Cleanup on unmount
  - Customizable connection options

✅ **useRoomList Hook**
- Test file: `src/features/room/hooks/useRoomList.test.ts`
- Implementation: `src/features/room/hooks/useRoomList.ts`
- Status: Fully implemented with 60.4% coverage
- Features:
  - Auto-fetch on connection
  - Real-time updates
  - Filtering and sorting
  - Error handling
  - Refresh functionality

### 4. Component Refactoring
✅ **RoomList Component Refactored**
- Location: `src/features/room/components/RoomList.tsx`
- Split into smaller components:
  - `RoomCard` - Individual room display
  - `CreateRoomModal` - Room creation modal
  - `JoinRoomModal` - Room join modal
  - `EmptyState` - Empty state display
- Uses custom hooks:
  - `useSocketConnection` for connection management
  - `useRoomList` for room list state
- Benefits:
  - Better separation of concerns
  - More testable components
  - Reusable sub-components
  - Cleaner code structure

### 5. Test Coverage Improvements
✅ **socketClient.ts**: Achieved 100% coverage
- Added comprehensive tests for all functions
- Covered error handling scenarios
- Tested event listener setup
- Verified connection state management

✅ **Room Page Component**: Improved coverage from 67.23% to 89.94%
- Added tests for event handlers
- Covered loading/error states
- Tested room not found scenarios

## Current Coverage Status
- **Overall**: 91.33% Statements (86.4% Branches, 79.59% Functions)
- **Key Files**:
  - socketClient.ts: 100% ✅
  - useSocketConnection.ts: 87.17%
  - useRoomList.ts: 60.4%
  - roomManager.ts: 83.44%
  - userStorage.ts: 89.14%

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority - Component Refactoring
1. ~~**Refactor RoomList.tsx**~~ ✅ COMPLETED

2. **Refactor QuizGame.tsx**
   - Extract timer logic into `useQuizTimer` hook
   - Create separate answer submission component
   - Split game state management

3. **Refactor Room.tsx**
   - Extract chat functionality into separate component
   - Use custom hooks for quiz management
   - Separate user management logic

4. **Refactor QuizCreator.tsx**
   - Extract form logic into `useQuizForm` hook
   - Create image upload component
   - Separate validation logic

### Medium Priority - Additional Hooks
1. Create `useQuizManagement` hook
2. Create `useChat` hook
3. Create `useGameState` hook
4. Create `useQuizTimer` hook

### Low Priority - Coverage Gaps
1. Improve `useRoomList.ts` coverage (currently 60.4%)
2. Cover remaining lines in `roomManager.ts`
3. Address uncovered lines in UI components

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Improved overall coverage from 88.59% to 91.33%
- ✅ Achieved 100% coverage on critical `socketClient.ts`
- ✅ Successfully implemented TDD approach
- ✅ Created reusable custom hooks
- ✅ Established feature-based folder structure
- ✅ Refactored RoomList component using new architecture

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Extracted Socket.io logic from components
- Improved testability with custom hooks
- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable code structure
- Reduced component complexity through splitting
